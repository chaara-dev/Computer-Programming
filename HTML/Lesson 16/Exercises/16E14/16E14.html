            My Childhood Days
        </h1>
        <p>
            The sweet memories of this period are glorious. They have the freshness of a dream. A child has no responsibilities; He is looked after by his parents. He gets everything without doing anything. A child enjoys perfect freedom. He has no worries, no hardships and no troubles. He can say anything to anybody. If a child does something wrong, he is generally excused. Even his meaningless chatter is a source of joy. A child's life is full of innocence. He builds castles of sand and feels very happy. He gets joy in floating paper boats. He often quarrels with others over small things but soon forgets about it, Childhood is really the golden period of one's life.
