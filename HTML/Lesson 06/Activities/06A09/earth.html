        The <font color="light blue">Earth</font> is our planet. It's the third rock from the sun, and it's covered in 
        liquid water. It contains a molten core that swirls and churns, creating the magnetic field that makes our 
        compasses work. Clouds float high in the atmosphere and rain down refreshing drops of water on the 
        <font color="light blue">Earth</font>'s many life forms.
