            <font color="fuchsia">Jupiter</font> is named after the leader of the Roman gods, and it is quite fitting 
            since <font color="fuchsia">Jupiter</font> has more mass than the rest of the planets in the solar system 
            combined. It's so humonguous that it could have become a star like the sun if it was just a bit bigger. 
            It has such a strong gravitational pull that it has a solar-system-like collection of moons orbiting around 
            it.
