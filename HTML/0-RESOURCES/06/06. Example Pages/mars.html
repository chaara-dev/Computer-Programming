Mars is known as the "Red Planet".  The Romans thought that it was the land of wars and bloodshed, so they named it after the Roman god of war.  Percival Lowell spotted canals on Mars and thought that Martians lived there.  However, the Viking spacecraft landed on Mars and found that there was no life, and no blood, just rusty rocks.
